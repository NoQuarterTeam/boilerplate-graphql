## Get Started

**Must have node, yarn/npm, postgres and redis installed and setup locally**

Delete whatever packages you don't need for the project, e.g. maybe you dont need the React Native app

1. `git clone https://github.com/NoQuarterTeam/boilerplate.git`
2. `yarn install`
3. `createdb boilerplate` (must have postgres setup locally)
4. `cd packages/api && yarn watch`
5. `cd packages/web && yarn dev`
6. `cd packages/app && yarn start`

Make sure you have created a .env file with the right values, use .env.example as the template

### For mailers

- Create a Sendgrid account and set a SENDGRID_API_KEY environment variable in .env
- Create templates for each email you want to send and use the templateId in the corresponding mailer class

### For error tracing

- Create a Sentry account + project for each package and add the DSN to the web config and the api env variables

### Deployment

An example is deployed [here](https://boilerplate.noquarter.co)

We are using Heroku for the API package and Vercel for the WEB package

(Our heroku app is on the free tier so there is a warm up time before it becomes responsive)
