## Get Started

**Must have node, yarn, postgres and redis installed and setup locally**

Delete whatever packages you don't need for the project, e.g. maybe you dont need the React Native app

1. `yarn install`
2. `createdb boilerplate`
3. `cd packages/api && yarn db:migrate`

Make sure you have created a .env file in the api package with the right values, you can use .env.example as the template

We use Husky to run a couple of checks each commit (prettier, eslint & commitlint), make sure to add a
.huskyrc file to your home directory ~/.huskyrc, and add this in:

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"
```

then run

```bash
npx husky install
```


## Development

1. `cd packages/api && yarn watch`
2. `cd packages/web && yarn dev`
3. `cd packages/app && yarn start`


## Production

### Mailers

- Create a Sendgrid account and set a SENDGRID_API_KEY environment variable in .env
- Create templates for each email you want to send and use the templateId in the corresponding mailer class

### Error tracing

- Create a Sentry account + project for each package and add the DSN to the web config and the api env variables

### Deployment

An example is deployed [here](https://boilerplate.noquarter.co)

We are using Heroku for the API package and Vercel for the WEB package
